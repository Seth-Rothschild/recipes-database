* About
This is a place for me to learn postgreSQL. The main idea is
that given a table of recipes and ingredients I should be able to
  1. Be able to output cooking instructions for a recipe
  2. Make a weekly shopping list
  3. Calculate calories per meal
  4. See which recipes work best with ingredients in my pantry and
  5. Approximate the cost of the shopping list

* Improvements to make
** TODO Queries
  + Need to figure out how to sort by number of occurances
  + Need to calculate the cost
** TODO Structural
  + Cup_to_grams needs to be Units_to_grams
  + Units needs to be real instead of an integer
  + Need a pantry table with expiration and quantity owned.
    That's n:1 with ingredients.
  + Need an index on names of stuff
** TODO Other
  + Needs to be much easier to input data
