* About
This is a place for me to learn postgreSQL. The main idea is
that given a table of recipes and ingredients I should be able to
  1. Be able to output cooking instructions for a recipe
  2. Make a weekly shopping list
  3. Calculate calories per meal
  4. See which recipes work best with ingredients in my pantry and
  5. Approximate the cost of the shopping list

* Improvements to make
** TODO Structural
  + Need a pantry table with expiration and quantity owned.
    That's n:1 with ingredients.
  + Need to standardize unit input to do calorie calculation
** TODO Other
  + Get started with psycopg2
  + Write python functions to run queries
  + Write python functions to prompt for new table entries
** Changelog
  + Changed recipe_id, ingredient_id -> id
  + Switch to "in" instead of conditional
  + Indexed names
  + Sort "pantry search" by a count
  + Changed cup_to_grams -> unit_to_grams
  + Names are unique
